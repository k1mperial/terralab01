# Terraform Lab 1


Still working on these 2 items but the terraform file main.tf builds the infrastructure below  <br />
1. Break up the root module into a separate DB and EC2 module  <br />
2. I had to create an second (empty) private subnet just to satisfy the requirements for DB subnet groups. I am still trying to find a workaround for this as I want only 1 private subnet
